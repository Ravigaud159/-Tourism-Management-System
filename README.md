Tourism-Management-System

"This is my bridge course project, where I created the frontend (UI) of a website using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It includes a login page that allows users to access the main page of the project. The project features multiple trip and hotel management packages, along with a facility for tour reviews."
