Tourism Management System

The Tourism Management System is a frontend-focused web application developed as a part of my bridge course project. The aim of this project was to build a functional and visually engaging user interface for a tourism-related platform using core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla).

This project simulates a tourism portal where users can log in, browse various tour and hotel packages, and engage with user-generated reviews. It was designed with simplicity and usability in mind, while also demonstrating key frontend development concepts and user experience principles.

Project Overview

The system consists of the following key components:

Login Page:
The entry point of the application includes a basic login form that validates user credentials (static for demo purposes). Once logged in, users are redirected to the main page of the site.

Main Interface:
After logging in, users gain access to the main content area, where they can explore a curated list of tour and hotel packages. Each package includes essential details such as destination, duration, price, and amenities, helping users make informed travel decisions.

Tour Review Section:
This feature allows users to view and submit reviews for specific tours. It demonstrates how a basic review system can enhance interactivity and provide valuable feedback for other users.


Technologies Used

HTML – for creating the structural layout of the web pages

CSS – for styling the interface and ensuring responsiveness

JavaScript – for adding interactivity, form validation, and dynamic behaviors


Purpose & Learning Outcomes

The purpose of this project was to apply the frontend concepts learned during my bridge course in a real-world scenario. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Designing responsive and user-friendly layouts

Structuring pages using semantic HTML

Applying CSS for styling and positioning

Implementing basic JavaScript for form validation and UI interactions


Future Improvements

While this version focuses on the frontend, future iterations of the project could include:

Backend integration for real authentication and database storage

User registration and profile management

Admin panel to manage tour packages and reviews

Enhanced filtering/searching of packages
