# Tourism Management System

The Tourism Management System is a frontend-focused web application developed as a part of my bridge course project. The aim of this project was to build a functional and visually engaging user interface for a tourism-related platform using core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla).

This project simulates a tourism portal where users can log in, browse various tour and hotel packages, and engage with user-generated reviews. It was designed with simplicity and usability in mind, while also demonstrating key frontend development concepts and user experience principles.

# Project Overview

The system consists of the following key components:

# Login Page:
The entry point of the application includes a basic login form that validates user credentials (static for demo purposes). Once logged in, users are redirected to the main page of the site.

# Main Interface:
After logging in, users gain access to the main content area, where they can explore a curated list of tour and hotel packages. Each package includes essential details such as destination, duration, price, and amenities, helping users make informed travel decisions.

Tour Review Section:
This feature allows users to view and submit reviews for specific tours. It demonstrates how a basic review system can enhance interactivity and provide valuable feedback for other users.

# Technologies Used

HTML – for creating the structural layout of the web pages

CSS – for styling the interface and ensuring responsiveness

JavaScript – for adding interactivity, form validation, and dynamic behaviors


# Purpose & Learning Outcomes

The purpose of this project was to apply the frontend concepts learned during my bridge course in a real-world scenario. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Designing responsive and user-friendly layouts

Structuring pages using semantic HTML

Applying CSS for styling and positioning

Implementing basic JavaScript for form validation and UI interactions


# Future Improvements

While this version focuses on the frontend, future iterations of the project could include:

Backend integration for real authentication and database storage

User registration and profile management

Admin panel to manage tour packages and reviews

Enhanced filtering/searching of packages


This project marks an important milestone in my journey as a web developer, showcasing the foundational skills necessary for building complete web applications.
